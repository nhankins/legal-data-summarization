# Legal Data Summarization

This repo contains data used to fine-tune a HuggingFace T5-small model for a summarization task. 

The first try at the model is saved on my HuggingFace account (@nhankins) or https://huggingface.co/nhankins/legal_data_summarizer-finetuned-legal
* Added model specification to HF training model card in 09/23

I'll continue to add to it through trial and error of checking the quality of the fine-tuning at inference. I'll also learn more about summarization metrics such as ROUGE scores.
